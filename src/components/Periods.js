        <h1>What are period cramps?</h1>
        <p>Letâ€™s crack the basic concept of what is it that makes you go through this ordeal. Period cramps are caused by compounds known as prostaglandins. Before your period starts each month, the level of prostaglandins in the lining of the uterus increases and is the highest on the first day. During your period, it is pretty common to feel discomfort around your abdomen, lower back, and thighs, as the muscles of your womb are contracting and relaxing to expel the built-up lining since your egg is not fertilized. The cramps you experience are nothing but your muscles at work!</p>

        <h1>Anti-inflammatory food</h1>
        <p>Ensure a balanced diet or look into foods to eat for a better period where you eat more vegetables and fruits, and reduce the consumption of fatty foods, for an easy period cramp remedy. Try reducing salt in your food, as excess salt intake encourages fluid retention leading to bloating. Herbal tea is warm and soothing, and in some cases may help in offering period pain relief.</p>

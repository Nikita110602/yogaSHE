        <p>Plow Pose, referred to as Halasana in Sanskrit, is an inverted yoga asana that strengthens, stretches and relaxes your body. This asana stretches the neck and thus stimulates the thyroid and pituitary glands. However, individuals suffering from hyperthyroidism should not perform this yoga asana as thyroid hormones are secreted during this pose.</p>
